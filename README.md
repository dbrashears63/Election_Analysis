# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you that following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources

### Data Source 
  There was a single data source for the Election Analysis Auditt

### Software
  Two software platforms were used to create the required programing code to perform the tasks assigned for the project.

  Visual Studio Code 1.72.2
  
  Python 3.10

## Summary

### Election Analysis Purpose
  Seth and Tom of the Colorado Board of Elections initially tasked us to audit the results of a US congressional precinct in Colorado to find the total number of         votes, the name of each candidate, the total vote count for each candidate, and what percentage of the votes each received.  
  The audit performed for the Board of Elections verified the results of the election. After these findings were presented Seth and Tom asked for some additional         information based on the original data we received from the Board of Elections. The task requested was to determine which county had the largest turnout, the total     number of votes for the county with the largest turnout and what percentage of the total for the county with the largest turnout.

## Election Analysis Overview
 
  The program that was created to perform the audit for voter verification and retrieve county data may be used for any other elections. It performed as expected and     verified the election. 
  
  This program could be used for the election of school board members. Minor modifications would be needed in the code, such as file names, and text changes for the     final output file. The county section could be modified for school districts.
  This program could be expanded to include all precincts for the entire state of Colorado. The same logic could be used for all precincts
